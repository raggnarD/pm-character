RPG PM Portfolio Website

Overview

A single-page React + TypeScript application showcasing PM skills through an RPG character interface. The page features a side-by-side layout with a character picker on one side and skills charts on the other.

Technology Stack





React 18 with TypeScript for type safety



Vite for fast development and building



Recharts for spider charts (soft skills) and horizontal bar charts (hard skills)



Framer Motion for smooth animations



CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS for styling (dark theme)



React Icons for UI elements

Component Architecture

CharacterPicker Component





Sprite Toggle Tabs: Three tabs (8-bit, FF7, FF7 Rebirth) to switch sprite views



Sprite Display: Large centered sprite image that updates based on selected tab



State Management: Uses React useState to track active sprite style



Animations: Fade/scale transitions when switching between sprite styles



Placeholder: Shows placeholder image or message until actual sprites are provided

SkillsCharts Component





Soft Skills Spider Chart: 





7 skills displayed on radar/spider chart



Skills: Communication, Leadership, Problem-Solving, Adaptability, Negotiation, Conflict Resolution, Emotional Intelligence



Scale: 0-100



Hard Skills Bar Chart:





5 skills displayed as horizontal bars



Skills: Planning & Organization, Risk Management, Time Management, Stakeholder Management, Methodologies & Tools



Scale: 0-100



Data Structure: TypeScript interfaces for type safety



Placeholder Data: Initial values set to 0 or placeholder numbers until real data provided

Layout





Side-by-Side Layout: 





Left side: Character picker (40-50% width)



Right side: Skills charts (50-60% width)



Responsive: Stacks vertically on mobile



Dark Theme: FF7-inspired dark color palette (dark blues, greens, mako-like colors)



Animations: Page load animations, chart reveal animations

Data Structure

interface SoftSkill {
  name: string;
  value: number; // 0-100
}

interface HardSkill {
  name: string;
  value: number; // 0-100
}

interface SkillsData {
  softSkills: SoftSkill[];
  hardSkills: HardSkill[];
}

Implementation Details

Styling Approach





Dark theme with FF7 color palette



RPG-style UI elements (borders, fonts)



Smooth transitions and hover effects



Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

Animation Strategy





Character sprite: Fade/scale transition on tab change



Charts: Staggered reveal animation on page load



Bars: Animate from 0 to target value



Spider chart: Draw animation on mount

Image Handling





Placeholder structure ready for sprite images



Support for different image formats (PNG, WebP)



Optimized loading with lazy loading if needed

Development Phases





Project Setup: Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project with dependencies



Layout & Styling: Create dark theme, side-by-side layout, responsive design



Character Picker: Implement tab interface and sprite switching with animations



Skills Charts: Build spider chart and bar chart components with Recharts



Integration: Connect components, add animations, polish UI



Placeholder Data: Set up data structure for easy skill value updates later

Dependencies





react, react-dom



typescript



vite



@vitejs/plugin-react



recharts



framer-motion



react-icons (optional, for UI elements)

Notes





Sprite images will be added later - placeholder structure prepared



Skill values will be provided later - data structure ready for easy updates



All components will be fully typed with TypeScript



Code will be modular and maintainable for future enhancements
